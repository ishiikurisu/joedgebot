# Joe's Judge Bot

A.k.a. @joedgebot for those who are used to it.

This bot was written to be ran with Python 3.4.4 with [Telepot](https://github.com/nickoala/telepot) and [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

# Usage

I currently am working on some tests to develop the `Judge` class that will be used during the application. Its unit tests can be run with:

```
make test
```

The idea is to permit the bot to run one script at a time by running:

```
make do API=YOUR_API_HERE
```
